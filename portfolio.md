# Portfolio

This document groups multiple solutions for short data science problems. Here I propose some code snippets , system design architectures or short articles describing a solution for a particular problem.

### **Highlights**
#### Short Posts
- System design for an ML training architecture using online and batch learning to solve an anomaly detection problem: https://t.co/7PqZh9yQ83
- Comparing Databases: https://github.com/AsmaZgo/DataScienceMulti/blob/master/Database_comparing.MD
#### Notebooks
- Jupyter notebook for semi supervised learning using Label propagation: https://github.com/AsmaZgo/DataScienceMulti/blob/master/credit-risk-data-semi-supervised.ipynb
- Databricks notebook for Text summary using HuggingFace LLMs inside of a Spark Dataframe: https://github.com/AsmaZgo/DataScienceMulti/blob/master/TextSummaryDatabricksHF.ipynb
