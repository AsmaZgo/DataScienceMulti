# DataScienceMulti

This repository groups multiple solutions for short data science problems. Here I propose some code snippets , system design architectures or short articles describing a solution for a particular problem.

### **Highlights**
- System design for an ML training architecture using online and batch learning to solve an anomaly detection problem: https://t.co/7PqZh9yQ83
- Jupyter notebook for semi supervised learning using Label propagation: https://github.com/AsmaZgo/DataScienceMulti/blob/master/credit-risk-data-semi-supervised.ipynb
